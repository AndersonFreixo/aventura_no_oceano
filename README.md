# aventura_no_oceano
A simple game using Python and Pygame. The mechanics of the game is inspired by an old game called Jewel Thief. 

An example match:

This is my first complete game developed in Python. Currently being refactored.

The player controls a blue whale, and its goal is to keep itself alive dodging enemies 
(killing whales, narwhals and scuba divers) and feeding from all krills that appear on the screen. 
The game has an undefined number of levels. As the player completes game cycles, the game gets faster.
