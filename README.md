# aventura_no_oceano
A simple game using Python and Pygame. The mechanics of the game is inspired by an old game called Jewel Thief. 

An example match can be seen <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cumRWPPtDGs">here</a>.

This was my first complete game developed in Python. The player controls a blue whale, and its goal is to keep itself alive dodging enemies 
(killing whales, narwhals and scuba divers) feeding from all skrills that appear on the screen to go to the next level. 
The game has an undefined number of levels. As the player advances completes game cycles, the game gets faster.
